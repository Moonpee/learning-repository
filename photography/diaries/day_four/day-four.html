                Today, I began taking up the camera again after a long
                break. I have no excuses for my procrastination, but
                I'm glad that I am finally back at it again. 

                <p>With that said, I thought of implementing some improvements 
                to the way I took pictures. For one, I actually started 
                taking inspiration from cool photographs and copying their
                techniques (This made picture taking ten times harder and 
                longer, but helped with quality). Another thing I settled 
                to do was to take note of the stats like ISO or shutter 
                speed for each picture, so that I can review and 
                reference it later</p>

            <p>The sun burnt my soul and the inside of my jacket was swampy.
                It was hard to find the right angle and light, but, after 
                wedging a small rock and having the sun south-east of me, I was
                barely able to emulate it. This has become one of my proudest 
                photos in my journey, and I have learnt a newfound respect for 
                photographers because this was hard beyond reason to create.
