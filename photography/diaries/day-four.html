                Today, I began taking up the camera again after a long
                break. I have no excuses for my procrastination, but
                I'm glad that I am finally back at it again. 

                <p>With that said, I thought of implementing some improvements 
                to the way I took pictures. For one, I actually started 
                taking inspiration from cool photographs and copying their
                techniques (This made picture taking ten times harder and 
                longer, but helped with quality). Another thing I settled 
                to do was to take note of the stats like ISO or shutter 
                speed for each picture.</p>
